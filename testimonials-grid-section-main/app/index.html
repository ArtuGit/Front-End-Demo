    <h2 class="caption">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
      in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>

    <p class="content">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
      The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
      the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

    <h2 class="caption">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from
      them
      and learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>

    <p class="content">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
      program
      gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
      junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

    <h2 class="caption">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>

    <p class="content">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
      professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
      did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
      could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
      100% recommend! ”</p>
